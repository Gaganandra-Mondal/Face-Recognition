# Face-Recognition
Face recognition is a technology that uses biometric data to identify or verify individuals based on their facial features. It involves capturing an image of a personâ€™s face and then analyzing various aspects of it, such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contour of the jawline.
Here are some key points about face recognition:

How It Works:

Detection: The system first detects a face in an image or video.
Extraction: It then extracts key features from the face.
Matching: The extracted features are compared to a database of known faces to find a match.
Applications:

Security: Used for unlocking devices, surveillance, and identity verification.
Personalization: Helps tailor user experiences, like customized advertising.
Social Media: Assists in tagging people in photos and videos.
Technology:

2D vs. 3D: 2D systems capture flat images, while 3D systems use depth information for better accuracy.
Machine Learning: Modern systems often use deep learning algorithms to improve accuracy and adaptability.
Privacy and Ethical Considerations:

Data Security: Concerns about how facial data is stored and protected.
Consent: The importance of obtaining permission before collecting and using facial data.
Bias and Accuracy: Ensuring systems are fair and accurate across different demographics.
